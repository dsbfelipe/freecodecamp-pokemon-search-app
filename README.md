This Pok√©mon Search App project was created as a certification requirement for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course from freeCodeCamp. The objective was to develop an application that allows users to search for Pok√©mon by name or ID and display relevant details such as type, weight, height, and stats. The app retrieves data from the freeCodeCamp Pok√©API Proxy and provides an engaging and interactive interface for Pok√©mon enthusiasts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is part of the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course. Although freeCodeCamp provides guidelines and user stories for certification projects, it does not offer tutorials or step-by-step guides for development. This project was built entirely from scratch using my own approach to meet the requirements.

## üìù Project Objective

The objective of this project was to create a Pok√©mon search app similar to the <a href="https://pokemon-search-app.freecodecamp.rocks/">example provided by freeCodeCamp</a>. The app allows users to search for Pok√©mon by name or ID and displays various details, including the Pok√©mon's name, type, weight, height, and base stats such as HP, Attack, Defense, and Speed. It also displays the Pok√©mon's front sprite image and handles cases where a Pok√©mon is not found. This project was an opportunity to practice **Fetch API**, **asynchronous programming**, and **promises**, which were covered in the last module of the course.

## üîß Features

- **Input Field**: An `input` element with id `search-input` where users can enter the Pok√©mon name or ID.

- **Search Button**: A `button` element with id `search-button` that initiates the search when clicked.

- **Pok√©mon Details**: Elements to display the Pok√©mon's details:

  - `#pokemon-name` for the name.

  - `#pokemon-id` for the ID.

  - `#weight` for the weight.

  - `#height` for the height.

  - `#hp`, `#attack`, `#defense`, `#special-attack`, `#special-defense`, and `#speed` for the Pok√©mon‚Äôs base stats.

  - `#types` for the Pok√©mon's type(s), which changes background color dynamically based on the type.

  - A dynamically added `img` element with id `sprite` to display the Pok√©mon‚Äôs sprite image.

- **Error Handling**: If the Pok√©mon is not found (e.g., the user enters "Red"), an alert with the message "Pok√©mon not found" is displayed.

- **Dynamic Type Coloring**: Each Pok√©mon's type is highlighted with a background color that corresponds to its type, making the UI more engaging.

## üìñ Learnings

- **Fetch API and Asynchronous Programming**: This project required the use of the Fetch API to retrieve Pok√©mon data from the Pok√©API proxy. Asynchronous functions were utilized to handle the API requests and responses.

- **DOM Manipulation**: The project involved updating various elements dynamically based on the search results. This improved my understanding of how to manipulate the DOM in response to user inputs.

- **Error Handling**: Learned to handle errors gracefully, including cases where the Pok√©mon is not found, and ensuring the UI remains functional.

- **Type Handling and Styling**: Implemented dynamic styling for Pok√©mon types, which required creating a map of types to colors and applying it based on the type returned by the API.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring the application.

- **CSS3** for styling and providing visual feedback for Pok√©mon types and error messages.

- **JavaScript** for functionality, including handling user inputs, fetching data, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous processing.

## üí° Acknowledgments

- **freeCodeCamp**: For providing the project guidelines and user stories that served as the basis for this application.

- **Pok√©API**: For providing the comprehensive Pok√©mon data, which was accessed through the freeCodeCamp Pok√©API Proxy.
